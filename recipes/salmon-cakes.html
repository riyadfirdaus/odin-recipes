        <p>Wondering how to make salmon cakes? This is a recipe for my grandmother's famous salmon cakes. It's a family recipe that has been passed down through generations. Serve them with macaroni and cheese or any other type of side dish.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>1 can salmon, drained adn flaked</li>

            <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Pick through salmon to remove any bones or large pieces of skin.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
            Beat eggs in a mixing bowl. Stir in salmon, onion, and black pepper. Mix thoroughly.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>
            Shape salmon mixture into eight 2-ounce patties.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry patties until crispy and golden brown on the outsides, about 5 minutes per side; work in batches if necessary to avoid crowding the pan.
